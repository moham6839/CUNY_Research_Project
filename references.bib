	abstract = {In team sports, traditional ranking statistics do not allow for the simultaneous evaluation of both individuals and combinations of players. Metrics for individual player rankings often fail to consider the interaction effects between groups of players, while methods for assessing full lineups cannot be used to identify the value of lower-order combinations of players (pairs, trios, etc.). Given that player and lineup rankings are inherently dependent on each other, these limitations may affect the accuracy of performance evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel adjusted box score plus-minus (APM) approach that allows for the simultaneous ranking of individual players, lower-order combinations of players, and full lineups. The method adjusts for the complete dependency structure and is motivated by the connection between APM and the hypergraph representation of a team. We discuss the similarities of our approach to other advanced metrics, demonstrate it using NBA data from 2012-2022, and suggest potential directions for future work.},

	abstract = {Adjusted plus minus (APM) measures have redefined our understanding of player value in basketball and hockey, where both are team games featuring player productivity spillovers. APM measures use seasonal play-by-play data to estimate individual player contributions. If a team's overall score margin success is figuratively represented by a pie, APM measures are well-designed to slice the pie and attribute individual contributions accordingly. However, they do not account for the possibility that better players can increase the overall size of the pie and thus increase the size of the slice (overall APM value) for teammates. Herein, we use data from NBA player-season Real Plus Minus (RPM)—a leading APM measure—for all recorded player-seasons from 2013–19 and player lineup data to test whether RPM is related to teammate quality. We run sets of linear fixed effect regression models to explain variation in RPM across player-seasons. We also employ a two-stage least square (2-SLS) method for robustness check. Both empirical approaches address potential endogeneity in the relationship of interest. We find strong evidence that RPM is related to on-court teammate quality. Despite adjusting for teammate and opponent quality, RPM does not control for complementarity effects. As such, RPM is not suited for out-of-sample prediction.},

	abstract = {A typical approach to quantify the contribution of each player in basketball uses the plus–minus method. The ratings obtained by such a method are estimated using simple regression models and their regularized variants, with response variable being either the points scored or the point differences. To capture more precisely the effect of each player, detailed possession-based play-by-play data may be used. This is the direction we take in this article, in which we investigate the performance of regularized adjusted plus–minus (RAPM) indicators estimated by different regularized models having as a response the number of points scored in each possession. Therefore, we use possession play-by-play data from all NBA games for the season 2021–2022 (322,852 possessions). We initially present simple regression model-based indices starting from the implementation of ridge regression which is the standard technique in the relevant literature. We proceed with the lasso approach which has specific advantages and better performance than ridge regression when compared with selected objective validation criteria. Then, we implement regularized binary and multinomial logistic regression models to obtain more accurate performance indicators since the response is a discrete variable taking values mainly from zero to three. Our final proposal is an improved RAPM measure which is based on the expected points of a multinomial logistic regression model where each player’s contribution is weighted by his participation in the team’s possessions. The proposed indicator, called weighted expected points (wEPTS), outperforms all other RAPM measures we investigate in this study.},

This paper presents a framework for evaluating APM models and also describes an enhancement to APM which nearly doubles its accuracy. APM models are evaluated in terms of their ability to predict the outcome of future games not included in the model’s training data. This evaluation framework provides a principled way to make choices about implementation details. The enhancement is a Bayesian technique called regularization (a.k.a. ridge regression) in which the data is combined with a priori beliefs regarding reasonable ranges for the parameters in order to produce more accurate models.},

	abstract = {In this work we analyse basketball play-by-play data in order to evaluate the eﬃciency of diﬀerent ﬁve-man lineups employed by teams. Starting from the adjusted plus-minus framework, we present a model-based strategy for the analysis of the result of partial match outcomes, extending the current literature in two main directions. The ﬁrst extension replaces the classical response variable (scored points) with a comprehensive score that combines a set of box score statistics. This allows various aspects of the game to be separated. The second extension focuses on entire lineups rather than individual players, using a suitable extended model speciﬁcation. The model ﬁtting procedure is Bayesian and provides the necessary regularisation. An advantage of this approach is the use of posterior distributions to rank players and lineups, providing an eﬀective tool for team managers. For the empirical analysis, we use the 2018/2019 regular season of the Turkish Airlines Euroleague Championship, with play-by-play and box scores for 240 matches, which are made available by the league website. The results of the model ﬁtting can be used for several investigations as, for instance, the comparative analysis of the eﬀects of single players and the estimation of total and synergic eﬀects of lineups monitoring. Moreover, the behaviour of players and lineups during the season, updating the estimation results after each gameday, can represent a rather useful tool. basketball analytics, statistical model, play-by-play data, web-crawling, datadriven decision process.},
